### Line Number: 3
**Actual Code:**
```function app(){```
**Topic:** Style
**Guideline:** Use consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for classes and components).
**Review Comment:** The component name `app` should follow PascalCase naming convention to align with React standards.
**Corrected Code:**
```function App(){```
**Explanation:** React components typically use PascalCase for naming to distinguish them from regular JavaScript functions and variables.

## Review comments based on NFR aspects:

### Performance/Efficiency Review Comments:
No specific performance issues identified in the code. The code is efficient for its functionality.

### Dead/Unused Code Review Comments:
No dead or unused code identified in the snippet.

### Inefficient Code Constructs Review Comments:
No inefficient code constructs identified in the snippet.

### Modular Code Review Comments:
The code is not modular. It should be refactored into separate files for better maintainability and scalability. For example, the component can be moved to a separate file named `App.js`.

## Refactored Code:
```
# filename: App.js
import React from 'react'

function App(){
  const [name, setName] = React.useState('')
  const [nameList, setNameList] = React.useState([])

  function addName(){
    if(name !== ''){
      setNameList([...nameList, name])
      setName('')
    }
  }

  return(
    <div>
      <h1>Name List</h1>
      <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={addName}>Add</button>
      <ul>
        {nameList.map((name, i) => <li key={i}>{name}</li>)}
      </ul>
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```
