Review Comments based on Guidelines:

Line Number: 3
Actual Code: ```function app(){```
Topic: Style
Guideline: Use consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for classes and camelCase for functions).
Review Comment: The function name `app` should follow PascalCase as it represents a React component.
Corrected Code: ```function App(){```
Explanation: React components are conventionally named using PascalCase to distinguish them from regular JavaScript functions and improve readability.
Confidence Score: 1.0

Line Number: 4
Actual Code: ```const [nm,setnm]=React.useState('')```
Topic: Readability
Guideline: Use meaningful and descriptive variable names.
Review Comment: The variable names `nm` and `setnm` are not descriptive. They should be renamed to `name` and `setName` for better readability.
Corrected Code: ```const [name, setName] = React.useState('')```
Explanation: Using descriptive variable names improves code readability and makes the code easier to understand.
Confidence Score: 1.0

Line Number: 5
Actual Code: ```const [lst,setlst]=React.useState([])```
Topic: Readability
Guideline: Use meaningful and descriptive variable names.
Review Comment: The variable names `lst` and `setlst` are not descriptive. They should be renamed to `nameList` and `setNameList` for better readability.
Corrected Code: ```const [nameList, setNameList] = React.useState([])```
Explanation: Using descriptive variable names improves code readability and makes the code easier to understand.
Confidence Score: 1.0

Line Number: 7
Actual Code: ```function addname(){```
Topic: Style
Guideline: Use consistent naming conventions (camelCase for functions).
Review Comment: The function name `addname` should follow camelCase naming convention.
Corrected Code: ```function addName(){```
Explanation: Following camelCase for function names is a standard JavaScript convention that enhances code consistency and readability.

Line Number: 11
Actual Code: ```<input value={nm} onChange={e=>setnm(e.target.value)}/>
```
Topic: Readability
Guideline: Use meaningful and descriptive variable names.
Review Comment: The variable `nm` should be replaced with `name` for better readability.
Corrected Code: ```<input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />```
Explanation: Using descriptive variable names improves code readability and makes the code easier to understand.

Actual Code: ```{lst.map((n,i)=><li key={i}>{n}</li>)}```
Topic: Readability
Guideline: Use meaningful and descriptive variable names.
Review Comment: The variable `lst` should be replaced with `nameList` for better readability, and `n` should be renamed to `name`.
Corrected Code: ```{nameList.map((name, i) => <li key={i}>{name}</li>)}```
Explanation: Using descriptive variable names improves code readability and makes the code easier to understand.

Review comments based on NFR aspects:

Performance/Efficiency Review Comments: The code uses array indexes (`i`) as keys in the `map` function, which can lead to rendering issues if the list is reordered. Use stable unique IDs instead of array indexes as keys.

Dead/Unused Code Review Comments: No dead or unused code was found in the provided snippet.

Inefficient Code Constructs Review Comments: The code does not have any inefficient constructs, but using array indexes as keys in the `map` function is not recommended for dynamic lists.

Modular Code Review Comments: The code is not modular. It should be split into separate components or modules for better maintainability. For example, the input and list rendering logic can be moved to separate components.

Refactored Code:
```
# filename: App.js
import React from 'react';
import NameInput from './NameInput';
import NameList from './NameList';

function App() {
  const [name, setName] = React.useState('');
  const [nameList, setNameList] = React.useState([]);

  function addName() {
    if (name !== '') {
      setNameList([...nameList, name]);
      setName('');
    }
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Name List</h1>
      <NameInput name={name} setName={setName} addName={addName} />
      <NameList nameList={nameList} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

# filename: NameInput.js
import React from 'react';

function NameInput({ name, setName, addName }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <input value={name} onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={addName}>Add</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default NameInput;

# filename: NameList.js
import React from 'react';

function NameList({ nameList }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {nameList.map((name, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

export default NameList;
```
