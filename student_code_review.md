Review Comments based on Guidelines:

Line Number: 1
Actual Code: ```import java.nio.file.*;```
Topic: Imports
Guideline: Avoid wildcard imports. Be precise to maintain code readability and avoid ambiguity.
Review Comment: Wildcard imports can lead to ambiguity and unnecessary inclusion of unused classes. Replace the wildcard import with specific class imports.
Corrected Code: ```import java.nio.file.Files; import java.nio.file.Paths;```
Explanation: Using specific imports improves code readability and ensures only the required classes are included, reducing potential conflicts.
Confidence Score: 1.0

Line Number: 2
Actual Code: ```Files.write(Paths.get("output.txt"), "Hello, World!\nLine 2\nLine 3".getBytes());```
Topic: Resource Management
Guideline: Always close I/O streams, sockets, and database connections in a finally block or use try-with-resources.
Review Comment: The code does not use a try-with-resources block to ensure proper resource management for file writing operations.
Corrected Code: 
```java
try {
    Files.write(Paths.get("output.txt"), "Hello, World!\nLine 2\nLine 3".getBytes());
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
Explanation: Using a try-with-resources block ensures that resources are properly closed after use, preventing potential resource leaks.
Confidence Score: 1.0

Review comments based on NFR aspects:

Performance/Efficiency Review Comments: The code does not exhibit any significant performance issues. However, using specific imports can slightly improve compilation time and reduce ambiguity.

Dead/Unused Code Review Comments: No dead or unused code is found in the snippet.

Inefficient Code Constructs Review Comments: The code does not exhibit inefficient constructs. The use of `Files.write` is appropriate for the task.

Modular Code Review Comments: The code is not modular as it directly performs file writing without encapsulating the functionality in a reusable method or class.

Refactored Code:
```java
// filename: FileWriterUtil.java
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileWriterUtil {
    public static void writeToFile(String filePath, String content) {
        try {
            Files.write(Paths.get(filePath), content.getBytes());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

// filename: Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FileWriterUtil.writeToFile("output.txt", "Hello, World!\nLine 2\nLine 3");
    }
}
```

Explanation: The refactored code splits the functionality into a utility class (`FileWriterUtil`) and a main class (`Main`). This improves modularity, reusability, and maintainability. The utility class encapsulates the file writing logic, making it reusable across different parts of the application.
