Review Comments based on Guidelines:

Line Number: 1
Actual Code: ```import java.nio.file.*;```
Topic: Imports
Guideline: Avoid wildcard imports. Be precise to maintain code readability and avoid ambiguity.
Review Comment: Using wildcard imports can lead to ambiguity and unnecessary inclusion of unused classes. Replace the wildcard import with specific class imports.
Corrected Code: ```import java.nio.file.Paths;```
Explanation: This change ensures that only the required classes are imported, improving code readability and maintainability.
Confidence Score: 1.0

Line Number: 2
Actual Code: ```Files.write(Paths.get("output.txt"), "Hello, World!\nLine 2\nLine 3".getBytes());```
Topic: Resource Management
Guideline: Always close I/O streams, sockets, and database connections in a finally block or use try-with-resources.
Review Comment: The code does not use try-with-resources to ensure the file resource is properly closed after writing. This can lead to resource leaks.
Corrected Code: 
```java
try {
    Files.write(Paths.get("output.txt"), "Hello, World!\nLine 2\nLine 3".getBytes());
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
Explanation: Wrapping the file writing operation in a try-catch block ensures that any exceptions are handled properly, and resources are managed effectively.
Confidence Score: 0.9

Review comments based on NFR aspects:

Performance/Efficiency Review Comments: The code does not exhibit any significant performance issues. However, using try-with-resources could slightly improve resource management efficiency.

Dead/Unused Code Review Comments: No dead or unused code was found in the snippet.

Inefficient Code Constructs Review Comments: The code does not use inefficient constructs. However, the use of wildcard imports could lead to inefficiency in larger projects.

Modular Code Review Comments: The code is not modular as it directly performs file writing without encapsulating the functionality into a reusable method or class.

Refactored Code:
```java
// filename: FileWriterUtil.java
import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.io.IOException;

public class FileWriterUtil {
    public static void writeToFile(String fileName, String content) {
        try {
            Files.write(Paths.get(fileName), content.getBytes());
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}

// filename: Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FileWriterUtil.writeToFile("output.txt", "Hello, World!\nLine 2\nLine 3");
    }
}
```

The refactored code splits the functionality into two modules: `FileWriterUtil.java` for file writing logic and `Main.java` for execution. This improves modularity and reusability.
