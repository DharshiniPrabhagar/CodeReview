Review Comments based on Guidelines:

Line Number: 1
Actual Code: ```import java.nio.file.*;```
Topic: Imports
Guideline: Avoid wildcard imports. Be precise to maintain code readability and avoid ambiguity.
Review Comment: Avoid using wildcard imports as they can lead to ambiguity and unnecessary inclusion of unused classes. Use specific class imports instead.
Corrected Code: ```import java.nio.file.Files; import java.nio.file.Paths;```
Explanation: Using specific imports improves code readability and ensures only the required classes are included, reducing potential conflicts.
Confidence Score: 1.0

Line Number: 2
Actual Code: ```Files.write(Paths.get("output.txt"), "Hello, World!\nLine 2\nLine 3".getBytes());```
Topic: Resource Management
Guideline: Always close I/O streams, sockets, and database connections in a finally block or use try-with-resources.
Review Comment: The code does not ensure that the file resources are properly closed. Use a try-with-resources block to manage the file resources automatically.
Corrected Code:
```java
try {
    Files.write(Paths.get("output.txt"), "Hello, World!\nLine 2\nLine 3".getBytes());
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```
Explanation: Using a try-with-resources block ensures that the file resources are properly closed, preventing resource leaks.
Confidence Score: 1.0

Review comments based on NFR aspects:

Performance/Efficiency Review Comments: No performance/efficiency issues were identified in the code.

Dead/Unused Code Review Comments: No dead or unused code was identified in the code.

Inefficient Code Constructs Review Comments: No inefficient code constructs were identified in the code.

Modular Code Review Comments: The code is not modular as it directly writes to a file without encapsulating the logic in a reusable method or class. Refactoring the code into a modular structure is recommended.

Refactored Code:
```java
// filename: FileWriterUtil.java
import java.io.IOException;
import java.nio.file.Files;
import java.nio.file.Paths;

public class FileWriterUtil {
    public static void writeToFile(String filePath, String content) throws IOException {
        Files.write(Paths.get(filePath), content.getBytes());
    }
}

// filename: Main.java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            FileWriterUtil.writeToFile("output.txt", "Hello, World!\nLine 2\nLine 3");
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
